Agent-Based System for Problem Solving with OpenAI and LangChain
This repository contains a Python script for creating an agent-based system that breaks down problems into sub-tasks, assigns tasks to different agents, and provides feedback loops to improve the task execution. The system utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model and LangChain framework for natural language processing and tool integrations.

Overview
The system follows these steps:

Problem Breakdown: The system uses a planner agent to break down a given problem into smaller sub-tasks.
Agent Task Execution: Each sub-task is executed by a randomly chosen agent, simulating different expertise (e.g., Researcher, Product Manager).
Feedback Loop: A critique agent reviews the outputs, providing feedback and prompting re-execution if necessary.
Final Compilation: The results are compiled into a final output.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -qU langchain-openai langchain langchain_community openai
Environment Setup
Set up the following environment variables to authenticate your API keys:

python
Copy code
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<Your_OpenAI_API_Key>"
os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = '<Your_Tavily_API_Key>'
Key Components
PlannerAgent: Breaks down the problem into sub-tasks using the OpenAI model.
TaskAgent: Executes individual sub-tasks by querying the OpenAI model, simulating various agents.
CritiqueAgent: Reviews the outputs and provides feedback to guide improvement.
AgentSystem: The main system that orchestrates task execution, feedback, and final result compilation.
Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the system to solve a problem:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    problem = "Analyze the impact of AI on education"
    system = AgentSystem()
    final_result = system.run(problem)
    print("Final Result:")
    print(final_result)
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Run the system: The AgentSystem starts by breaking down the provided problem (e.g., "Analyze the impact of AI on education") into 3 sub-tasks.

Agent Execution: Each sub-task is randomly assigned to an agent (e.g., Researcher, Expert, Product Manager), and the agent's model generates a response.

Feedback: The critique agent evaluates the results against the original plan and provides feedback for improvement.

Rework and Final Output: The system re-runs the task execution based on feedback and outputs a final result.

Example Output
bash
Copy code
Final Result:
Researcher: AI is transforming education by offering personalized learning experiences.
Product Manager: Integration of AI tools is increasing efficiency in educational institutions.
Expert: AI helps in assessing student performance with greater accuracy.
Customization
You can add more agents by extending the choose_agent() function.
Modify the feedback loop logic to implement more sophisticated feedback mechanisms.
Future Enhancements
Improve agent selection based on the specific nature of the sub-task.
Extend feedback and critique mechanisms to involve multiple iterations.
Incorporate more detailed task execution methods to simulate real-world problem-solving.
